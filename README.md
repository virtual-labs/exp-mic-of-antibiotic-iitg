<b> Experiment|     <b> Determination of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibiotic

### About the Experiment 

MIC is the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent expressed in mg/ml (Âµg/ml) which, under strictly controlled in vitro conditions, completely prevents visible growth of the test strain of an organism. The knowledge of MIC is essential for the clinicians in order to determine the correct antibiotic concentration for treating infections cause by certain bacterial species. In case of seriously ill-patients, who suffer from chronic infections and have been treated with broad spectrum of antibiotics and have a history of failed therapies, much more precise effective dosage of antibiotic is required. Among other parameters, MIC is an important one. It has significant impact on the choice of a therapeutic strategy.
